## Hello, we are the developers of EXFIL.
We used to make ROBLOX games, but now we're making a REAL game.

We're a small team learning C# and Unity through this game, so this will be a huge learning experience for us.
We hope you enjoy our project(s?)

# Our History
We used to work on ROBLOX games, such  as EXFIL.
I started out by making a small ROBLOX game with a free gun system called "EXFIL", and it was supposed to be Escape from Tarkov in ROBLOX.
After a while, it was too much for me, so I hired a team, and we switched to our own gun system. Eventually, we got a small portion of a map and a small amount of gun functionality in the game.

Now, here we are! This game has been in development for a year or two, and we hope it can finally come to life with Unity.

# The Team
As of now, there are 4 people working on this project.
